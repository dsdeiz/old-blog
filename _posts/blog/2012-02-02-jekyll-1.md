title: Migrating to Jekyll Part 1
category: blog
---

Recently, I read about a few Drupal blogs migrating over to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) &mdash; [acko.net](http://acko.net/blog/making-love-to-webkit/) and [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/). The concept seems nice as you will be writing the content in files instead of a database so I thought I would give it a try. With this, I am able to write blog posts using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). Also, on my current blog, I am using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as my input filter for writing blog posts.

## Installation &amp; Configuration

Installing **Jekyll** was easy as I had only to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install). Did the following steps to install it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install rubygems
$ sudo gem install jekyll
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygments
$ export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
{% endhighlight %}

For the path, I added it after on my `.bashrc`. I then created a directory structure based on [this](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Usage). I have also added the directories **css, images and fonts** that would store media files. And for my `_config.yml` file, I have this:

{% highlight yaml %}
baseurl: /
name: dsdeiz.github.com
pygments: true
{% endhighlight %}

## Setup

The current setup of my Jekyll site has 2 categories namely **blog** and **gallery**. The **blog** category would contain the actual blog posts as the **gallery** would contain images. The variables used for [YAML Front Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter) for my **blog** post only contain the basic ones:

* layout (value is *post* always)
* title
* category

For my **gallery** post, I have this format:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
layout: gallery
category: gallery
thumb: /images/screenies/thumbs/2011-04-08-162458_1366x768_scrot-thumb.png
image: /images/screenies/2011-04-08-162458_1366x768_scrot.png
---
{% endhighlight %}

I have created the **gallery** post type as only `txt` files, and no title and content as I don't think I would have an individual post for each. `thumb` and `image` are custom variables which I can use in my template files as `post.thumb` and `post.image` in the **Liquid templating system**.

For the gallery, I've created a bash script that creates a copy of full sized images, resizes the image to a width of `125px` and puts it on the thumbs folder with `-thumb` appended to the filename, and creates the `txt` files with the needed data inside them on `_posts`. This is what's inside the script:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh

img=${1%.*}
filename="$img.txt"
content="---
layout: gallery
category: gallery
thumb: /images/screenies/thumbs/$img-thumb.png
image: /images/screenies/$img.png
---"

convert -resize 125 "$1" "thumbs/$img-thumb.png"
echo "$content" > "../../_posts/$filename"
{% endhighlight %}

I already have existing images so I just did `for i in *.png; do ./gallery-gen.sh $i; done` for it to generate the gallery.

## Layout &amp; Style

I have a very basic layout as you can see. Not really that creative when it comes to designing. :P But anyway, for my `_layouts`, I had 2 files namely `default.html` which would be the main template and `post.html` which holds the template for posts.

For the style, I made use of [Bluetrip](http://bluetrip.org/) but removed it's grid function as I only wanted it's default styles. I've also used the `monokai` style which comes with `python-pygments`. I wasn't able to find where the CSS files from `python-pygments` so I did some googling to know how to get the styles on CSS. It then turned out that you had to generate it like this `pygmentize -f html -S monokai -a .highlight`. This can be found [here](http://pygments.org/docs/cmdline/#generating-styles). For the font, I am using [Droid Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans) from [Google web fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).

Next thing I would do would probably migrate the blogs posts from my current Drupal site over to Jekyll.

**Update:** I've decided to use dropbox to store the gallery images instead so I made some adjustments on the script that generates the thumbnails and gallery post files:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

WIDTH=125

IMG=${1##*/}
IMG=${IMG%.*}
FILENAME="`date +%F`-$IMG.txt"
# FILENAME="$IMG.txt"

IMG_DIR="$HOME/Dropbox/Public/screenies"
THUMBS_DIR="$HOME/Dropbox/Public/screenies/thumbs"
POSTS_DIR="$HOME/dsdeiz.github.com/_posts"

DROPBOX_UID=24796303
DROPBOX_PATH="${IMG_DIR##*/Public/}"
DROPBOX_THUMBS_PATH="${THUMBS_DIR##*/Public/}"

CONTENT="---
layout: gallery
category: gallery
thumb: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/$DROPBOX_UID/$DROPBOX_THUMBS_PATH/$IMG-thumb.png
image: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/$DROPBOX_UID/$DROPBOX_PATH/$IMG.png
---"

# Create a copy of the image over to Dropbox folder
if [[ ! -f "$IMG_DIR/$IMG.png" ]]
then
  cp "$1" "$IMG_DIR/$IMG.png"
fi

# Create a thumbnail for file
convert -resize $WIDTH "$1" "$THUMBS_DIR/$IMG-thumb.png"

echo "$CONTENT" > "$POSTS_DIR/$FILENAME"
{% endhighlight %}
